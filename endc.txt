You are transported to ELYSIUM.
Here is the land where purpose is everything.
It is a godfound land.
The ruler is the dogma of the gods themselves.
The Machine reigns supreme. 
In a white space is a floating cube with a grid-like texture.
Upon closer inspection, you realize that it is made up of cubicles upon cubicles upon cubicles…
Inside each cubicle is a human performing their respective office work.
They work in a rhythmic fashion, never stepping off beat.
Your presence isn’t even noticed.

Deus E. Machina
How happy am I that you will join me for the rest of your life.
Here, wear this. You’re always representing the company, so look sharp! 
Anyhow, I’d love to stay and chat, but time is money as they say, and there’s work to be done.
The Machine will notify you of your next task.
And remember, “Life is not complete without hard work!”

You put on your business casual costume.
Sitting at the desk, you log onto your personal computer.
A notification appears in the right hand corner.
It reads: “Enter data from last month’s transaction report into spreadsheet and send to management”.
A sudden determination flows through you.
You want to be a productive member of society.
If you please the higher ups, maybe they’ll let you go one step higher on Jacob’s ladder.
So you bottle up your worries and throw them to the side; they can be dealt with later.
After all, life is not complete without hard work.
