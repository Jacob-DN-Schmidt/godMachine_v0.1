You are transported to LIMBO.
Here is the land where the innocent reside.
It is a safe haven.
Her innocents are watched over by a tender and caring mother.
The environment fosters nurturement.
You stand naked in a green pasture, the long grass swaying in the wind.
Ahead of you is a colossal woman with a cow head standing in the nude.
“Come here my child,” Mother says.
You run towards her, and she picks you up.
Bringing you to her lips, she kisses you on the top of your head.
“You had me worried!” Mother sighs, “I thought maybe you were lost.” She stares at you; a gaze of pure love.
A look of concern washes over her face.
“Oh, my child! You lack nourishment!” She brings you down to her nipple.
You suckle on the valve, and out flows a wave of warm milk.
It is a feeling of euphoria.
You want more and won’t stop at nothing.
“Be sure to save some for the rest,” Mother warns.

You look down and see a mob of people climbing up Mother’s legs.
They are ravenous, pulling each other down like crabs in a bucket, but they will not stop for Mother’s nourishment.
“Kids, it’s dinner time!” she announces.
She lies the palms of her hands out flatly next to her breasts.
Some of the innocents reach the top, shoving each other out of the way to reach Mother’s nipples.
One of them knocks you to the ground.
You stand up and punch them.
Behind you a wave of people grab at your legs.
You try kicking them away, but the force is too great.
The crowd tramples over you, but you will not give up for another taste of that sweet nectar.
Everyone wants Mother’s Milk.
