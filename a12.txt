You decide to join the experiment.
Your life is better served as a cog in a machine of greater cause for humanity.
The surgeon, ecstatic, squeals and jumps in joy.
She pushes your bed out of the room, singing and skipping while pushing you down the hallway.
A freight elevator opens up, and the two of you head in.

Oh my god, I am so jealous!
Seriously, you won’t regret this.
Such a beautiful sacrifice you’re making.
Just so you know, you’ve entered a NDA.
If you tell anyone, we kill you.
Ah but I suppose that won’t matter in a few minutes.
Tehehe, I’m so excited for you!

The elevator opens its doors.
The surgeon guides your bed down a dark hallway, maneuvering around debris of defunct machines.
/s
bang
To the sides of you are locked cells that seem to infinitely stretch down the hallway.
/s
scream
A symphony of cries for help echo through the hallway.
As you go further down the corridor, a foul stench captures your attention.
A mix of rot and feces—you gag on impulse.
At the end of the corridor is a large steel door.
The eccentric surgeon scans her palm, and the door slowly cracks open.
She pushes you inside and closes the door.

Are you ready, my lovely guinea pig? I sure hope you are!

Cleopatra
Before you is a gargantuan fleshy creature made of an array of human body parts.
Every segment of its body has a mind of its own.
Its body pulls in multiple directions, confused as to what it’s supposed to do.
A couple of its arms try reaching in your direction.

Ahahaha, isn’t she beautiful??
I call her Cleopatra.
We’ve spent decades developing this project, and finally, FINALLY, we are getting close!
For so long have we been researching the limits of the human body.
We’ve studied them through excruciating pain.
Spinning them in a centrifuge, forcing them to wear chemical facemasks, crushing them with large objects, testing weapons on them, just to name a few.
The survivors were cut open while they were still alive so we could study how their insides work, what was making them win the game of Darwinism.
Our discovery was beautiful, truly beautiful. It makes me cry.
You see, I’m convinced that there’s something greater at play here; a perplexing energy that surges through these unscatheable organs.
We can’t quite explain the phenomenon, and there is much disagreement among us, some saying we are straying too far from science.
Still, we can detect the patterns, and you, my dear sweet guinea pig, match them perfectly.
You will be a vital organ to this beautiful creature.
Aren’t you happy? I truly envy you.
My duty is here—I must perform from the outside.
But you, well you get to become part of something grand, something that will change the world, and you don’t have to do a single thing.

Please… kill… us… please… end… us… They… want… to… des… troy… every… thing…

1. Try to kill the creature. End its suffering
2. Become part of the creature. You can be a part of a greater cause
