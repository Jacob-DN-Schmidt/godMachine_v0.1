You decide to help the fish carcass out.
Life or no life, this is a cry for help, and if you have the means to provide it, then dammit, you will.
You desperately pull against the leash.
The prongs insert into your neck, but the adrenaline masks the pain.
You pull and pull, until the leash falls to the ground.
Running, you make your way over to the carcass.

You grab the queen maggot from the fish carcass. It squirms around in your hand.
A sigh of relief runs across the fish’s face.

Come now! Eat the damn thing already!

Hesitantly, you bring the squirmy grub to your mouth.
You can do this; it’s all for welfare.
You drop the maggot into your mouth.
It wiggles around in your mouth, fighting for its life.
You crunch down and the maggot pops in your mouth.
You swallow the guts, feeling every lump slide down your throat.
Exhale. You have finished the job.

Ahahaha, what a stupid arsehole!
I can’t believe this dumb bloke actually ate that thing.
Did you really think you were helping some poor old fish?
I’m a dead fucking fish!
You suck the bellend of every cock by everyone who asks you to?
Hey fellas, take a look at Mother Theresa over here doing God’s good will!
Ahahahaha. God damn that IS too funny!

It seems you have been tricked into eating a maggot.
In your pursuit to help someone else you’ve been played for a fool.
But still, sometimes this is the consequence of helping others, right?
Something doesn’t rest well in your stomach.
It grumbles and rumbles; an escalating feeling of despair rising within.
You feel the rush of warm acidic vomit build up inside you.

vomit
Vomit spews from your mouth onto the carcass.

Oi, what the fuck do you think you’re doing? Get this shit off of me!

1. Throw the carcass off the side of the bridge. Fuck that fish. If it doesn’t want help, then help it will not receive
2. Mind your own business. It’s not worth wasting any more energy on such a lout
