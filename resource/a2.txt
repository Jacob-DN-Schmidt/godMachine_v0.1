You decide to observe.
It is wise to assess a situation before acting.
The fetuses bite at each other, ripping each other's gummy limbs off.
The single fetus tears off one of the conjoined fetuses’ heads.
In retaliation, the remaining head of the conjoined fetus tears off the single fetus’ head.
Having just lost its lifelong twin, the remaining half of the conjoined fetus dies of grief.

Omniscient Dog?
Hmmm, that was kinda fucked up. Welp, what did you learn from today’s lesson?
I’ll give you a minute to think… Done?
Today’s lesson is that you won’t always get a lesson just by observing.
Actually, I’m kind of surprised that you didn’t try to break up the fight.
I think most people’s first reaction is to intervene when they see two fetuses going at each other, but that makes you unique.
In a way, I respect it.
Who knows, maybe if you tried to intervene you would’ve died.
Anyhow, let’s keep going.

Omniscient Dog? puts the prong collar back around your neck.
It leads you down another path of the park.
The two of you cross a wooden bridge over a wide river.

Koi Fish Carcass
At the bridge’s apex, you stumble upon a rotting carcass of a koi fish.
It has maggots wrangling about it, feasting on its decomposing flesh.
Flies buzz around in a frantic dance.

Koi Fish Carcass
Oi, hello there, good chap! 
Splendid day today, innit? Though it is a tad bit windy.
Say, see that big bulbous grub on my back? Reckon you can pull it off me?
She is the queen of these buggers, but by golly is she sucking me dry.
You need to eat it for me, otherwise she will simply reproduce.
I don’t have enough flesh to satiate all of them!
/f
Omniscient Dog?
It’s bad to toy with the dead.
Come on, you slow fuck, let’s keep moving.
There’s no time for this.

Omniscient Dog? tugs on the leash, prongs nipping you on the neck.
But it seems like this fish really needs some help.
/c
1. Help the fish carcass out.
2. Keep following Omniscient Dog?.
