You decide to keep following Omniscient Dog?.
It is a waste to help those whose positionality has no use in this world.
Still, you wonder if you could’ve helped foster the lives of those maggots.
Stepping off the bridge, you enter a tunneled path made out of the canopy of trees.

Omniscient Dog?

Omniscient Dog?
Forget about that damn fish.
Its existence means nothing.
Thinking about it wastes the precious space of your neurons.

The trail is littered with a swarm of moths the size of birds.
They flutter around, knocking into each other, ramming into your face.
The swarm’s volume increases the further down the path you get.
You come upon a large opening in the path where the canopy does not reach.

chain
In the center is a person tethered by chains to a pole.

They sprint as fast as they can away from the pole, only to be met with a sudden halt.
Still, the person gets back up, and they sprint to the opposite side to try again.

Omniscient Dog?
Sisyphean, isn’t it? Such futile effort makes me laugh.
I feel sad for them. Still, there is something to be admired here.
The eternal struggle of mankind.
There’s no end in sight, yet they seem to keep going like there’s some kind of purpose they’re living for, like there’s a chance.
Even then, the purpose they believe they are living for is not the same as their true purpose of living.
They are experiencing life as it should be, whether they know it or not.

The chained person sprints again, this time towards you.
They stare at you with a wry smile. From their mouth they regurgitate a bronze key.
They clasp your hands around the key and turn around.
There is a keyhole on the back of the collar that connects them to the chain.
Guess they could’ve freed themselves the entire time.
Nevertheless, they beckon you to open the lock for them.
/c
1. Unlock the collar. Let them live free and choose their own life
2. Ignore their pleas. They are already living their true purpose
