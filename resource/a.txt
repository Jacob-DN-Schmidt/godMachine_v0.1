You decide to wash your sins away.
The sins do not define you.
Life is full of difficult decisions.
You turn on the faucet and scrub at your blood-stained arms.

Omniscient Dog?

Omniscient Dog?
I see. Interesting. 
Come, let’s take a walk outside. It’s beautiful out.

Narrator
You join Omniscient Dog? outside for a walk.
Before stepping out, it puts a collar around your neck and attaches it to a leash.
You stretch your neck to the side and are met with a sharp pointed pain.
It is a prong collar.
The two of you step outside.
Omniscient Dog? was right, it is gorgeous out.
Although, the sky is absent, just a dark looming void, like it always is.
Omniscient Dog? takes you to a park.
Seems like it doesn’t have any intention of playing fetch with you.
It could at least let you relieve yourself…
Instead, it forces you to sit on the bench next to it.

Omniscient Dog?
Sometimes it’s okay to just sit back and watch others make an ass of themselves.
Some people call it “people watching”.
I call it “projecting your shortcomings onto others to make yourself feel better”.
Seriously, try it.
Observe.

Narrator
You focus in on the view from the bench.
In front of you, in the open field, are a couple of fresh fetuses.

baby
One of them is a conjoined fetus.
The two, three?, of them flop around the field, umbilical cord flailing behind.
They seem to be playing with a ball.
But wait. Are they playing?
Oh shit.
They start screaming at each other, a confused scream, and clawing at each other with their stumpy little hands.
The single fetus bites the conjoined fetus.
The two heads of the conjoined fetus spew bloody vomit.
It lands on the single fetus, scalding its skin.
Omniscient Dog? unhooks the leash from your collar.
