You decide to get some clown therapy.
You need to take care of yourself before you can worry about others.
The surgeon frowns—seems like your good organs are going to waste.
She calls the clown therapist on speed dial.
A few minutes later, a middle aged man walks through the door.

Pizza Puppeteer
He is naked in pure flesh, save for a slice of pizza covering his gonads.
From each of his digits a pizza slice dangles from a thread.

Anybody want a pizza slice? Anybody want some pizza, ah!

The strange pizza man walks to your bedside.
Like multiple pendulums, he sways the pizza slices up and down in front of your face.
Losing focus, your eyes struggle to keep up with the slices.

You fixate on a droplet of grease slowly making its way down the slice, elegantly dropping on your forehead.
Yummy, warm, greasy slices.
Fresh melted cheese wafting in the air.

Pizza Puppeteer
Anybody want a pizza slice? 
I know you want some pizza, ah!
Come, I implore you, take a pizza slice!
Forget about the present—let it all collapse.
Just think about the juicy slice.
Think about the cheese cooling down in your mouth.
A gush of grease exploding in your mouth.
That gooey slice sliding down your throat.
Forget about everything else.
Life’s a bitch and then you die.
If we’re all gonna die anyways, why not just enjoy a slice of pizza? 
Just think about the pizza.
Live in the pizza.
Be the pizza.

The Pizza Puppeteer dangles the pizza over your open mouth.
Your mouth waters.
There is a strong urge in you to eat the pizza.
/c
1. Eat the pizza slice. Life’s too short
2. Resist the urge to consume pizza. The body is a temple
