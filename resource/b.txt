You decide to confess.
Maybe what you did was wrong.
Omniscient Dog? nods, but it is unclear whether or not it is in approval.
It takes you downstairs.
You find yourself in a dank concrete basement.
1000-year old mold wafts in the air.
The only source of light is a swaying lightbulb emanating a dim orange hue.
In the peripheral of the light is a wooden stool with a pair of lanky legs in front of it.

It scooches into the light and reveals a fleshy naked old man.

Fleshy Old Man
On his lap he strokes a scraggly bear cub, left ear and eye missing.
He beckons you to come closer and pats his hand on a dilapidated box with rusty nails sticking out.

Omniscient Dog?
Go ahead, sit down. It’s just an old man, pure skin and bones. He can’t hurt you.
Besides, this is your decision.

You sit down, careful not to be impaled by one of the nails. The box creaks at the pressure.

Hail there, sinner. I can smell the sin right off ye.
Hehehe, ripe sin. Sin, sin, sin.
So, have ye come to confess? Ain’t no entrance to the Elysium if ye don’t atone!
…
I shall take that as a “yes”.
Spare me the details! I know what you youngsters do these days.
Ye been watching porn, haven’t you?
Aha! The look on yer face tells me I’m right!
Dicks and tits, that’s all ye youngsters think about. Disgusting, impure thoughts.
I tell ye, ye be one step away from dropping to the deepest depths of Pandemonium.
Fear not, young sinner, for I have a solution for ye.
Atone and repent, and the entrance will remain open for ye.
All ye have to do is cut off yer genitalia.
And pay yer indulgence of just $777,777,777.77. I discounted it for ye.
/f
Omniscient Dog?
Jesus Christ… good luck with this one.

1. Tell the fleshy old man to fuck off
