You decide to interrogate the child.
Where is the respect for seniority these days?
You grab her by the shoulders and shake, demanding to know how to get out.
You feel some resistance and look down.
The ball of blue light shows its face to you, and it seems pissed.

Buddy, sincerely, eat shit.
I will tear you a new asshole by force.
What you just did was unsalvageable.
Laying your grimy fingers on her, you fucking sleazebag scum.
Lucky for you, today is your death day.
Hope your life was worth it.

The child tries to hold the Will o’ Wisp back, but it refuses.
Its luminescence grows brighter, trails of vapor rising from its back.
The child falls to the floor, hopeless.

Will o’ Wisp
Figures she would want to save you.
I want to listen, but you hurt her, you spineless bastard.
If it was me, fine, maybe I could forgive you.
However, I can’t, I simply can’t.
You humans, so foolish and so selfish.
Always out for yourselves.
No regard for your fellow neighbor.
I can’t stand it anymore.
This child, she taught me that there is some good in the world, that this world deserves redemption.
But I can no longer find it.
Each and every one of your souls, defiled and perverted.
It sickens me. Truly sickens me.
I have never met such a disgusting creature as mankind itself.
Farewell, and let these words travel with you in your next life.

Will o’ Wisp expands, absorbing the space around it.
An intense draft pulls you towards the blooming ball of energy.
You feel the increasing heat as you draw closer.
Your skin bubbles and pops, exposing you to your very bone.
The light makes contact with you, and you are absorbed into its mass.
Nothing but light.

1. Curse God. What a terrible life you’ve been given
2. Pray to God. Maybe you can be saved
