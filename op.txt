What will it be?
The separation of mind and body.
Of logic and emotion.
Godfound and Godless.

Omniscient Dog?
You killed them.
You killed them, didn’t you.
Ruthless cold-blooded murder.
Pretty badass.
But you had to do it, didn’t you?
The end justifies the means, and all that.
Don’t worry. I don’t blame you. Really, I don’t.
Except, you loved them.
It was hard to say goodbye, wasn’t it.
Or maybe this was your out.
You only convinced yourself to love them because it kept you grounded to reality.
A reality that wasn’t yours.

Omniscient Dog? places its paw on your shoulder.
It breathes down your neck and whispers in your ear.

Omniscient Dog?
Take a good look at yourself.
What is your reality? 
What is it you truly desire?
…
You’re lying to yourself.
Look closer, deep into the void.
Let it consume you.Let the darkness wrap around your fingers.
Allow it to penetrate every orifice of your body.

Feel as it fills the arteries of your heart.
Don’t worry—I won’t let you die. Not yet, at least.
Now look again. What do you see?

Now this, this is you.
Uniquely and truly you.
You wear the facade well, you know, for being such a dirty sinner.
A dirty, fucking sinner.
But that’s okay, I don’t judge.
Who has the power to truly judge, anyways?
