You are transported to PANDEMONIUM.
Here is the land where purpose is none.
It is a godless land.
The rulers are the very molecules that make up the world itself.
Entropy reigns supreme.
You stand in a jagged landscape, spiked rocks sprouting from the ground.
You are surrounded by the movement of people.
One by one, they pass around a canister and douse themselves with gasoline.
They pass the gasoline to you, and without thinking about it, you find yourself drenched.
One of them lights a cigarette and simultaneously self combusts.
The fire spreads as the people move in sporadic directions.
But they seem to be dancing.

A dance of some sort of expression of their humanly desires.
Like balls in a galton board, they bump into each other and into the rocks, and eventually someone bumps into you.
You are engulfed in flames, your body crisping to its core.
It’s painful. Really fucking painful.
Yet you don’t cry out in pain; somehow, you’ve never felt so alive.
You can’t help but smile.
You feel every desire to truly express yourself, no shame about it.
So you dance—a tango with yourself.
Your body moves as it so pleases.
Nothing, not even God, can stop you.
