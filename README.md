This project was made as a final project in my brother's digital story telling class while I was a senior in highschool. My brother was the creative director where I handled all of the back end design and implementation. 

This was my first time making a large project using the P5.js library. I had previously worked with it in a very limited scope a couple of months before. I had very little experience with coding in general when making this, so there is a lot that could be improved.

I decided to exclude the original illustrations due to their graphic nature. There were also plans to include sounds during certain storylines, but I was unable to implement them before the project was due because of the tight schedule we had to follow.
