This project was made as a final project in my brother's digital story telling class while I was a senior in highschool. My brother was the creative director where I handled all of the back end design and implementation. 

This was my first time making a large project using the P5.js library. I had previously worked with it in a very limited scope a couple of months before. I had very little experience with coding in general when making this, so there is a lot that could be improved.
