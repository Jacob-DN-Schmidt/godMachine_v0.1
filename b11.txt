You decide to eat the songbird.
Such beauty should not be wasted.
Napkin draped over your head, you grab the songbird by its head and eat it feet-first.
You swallow the songbird, entrails and all, spitting out the large bones.
It is delectable; the best meal you’ve ever had.
Your mouth is filled with a joyous spirit.

Omniscient Dog? pulls the napkin from your head.
You find that you no longer sit in a dank basement, but now stand on the edge of a shore.
Gentle waves rush around your legs and slyly draw back into the ocean.
A full moon and twinkling stars dot the rosy magenta sky.

Omniscient Dog?
This is your beauty, huh?
I see. Quite the mind, you have.
Though I can’t say you chose the right option.
I have a hunch the old man wanted you to drink his blood and piss.
But maybe it was worth it to see your true beauty.
I guess I wouldn’t know.
Up until now, you were so adamant to stay on the path of decorum, but desire strayed you from its path.
Was it worth it, for this moment of bliss?
Nevertheless, you still have a chance to find that path again, if it’s what you so choose to do.

The moonlight glistens off the dilapidating waves.
You notice a pink dancing shimmer in the water.
More appear, and they begin to form a rotating circle.
You realize the shimmers belong to glowing dolphins elegantly rippling through the ocean water.
They dance with each other in synchronized motion and raise their tails to the air.
Behind you, you hear a growl.
You turn around and see the bear cub from the cellar. It seems it wants you to follow it.

1. Walk into the ocean. Let the waves consume you
2. Follow the bear. There are repercussions to be paid
