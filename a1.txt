You decide to break up the fight.
You have the willpower to change the outcome.
In an attempt to reason with the fetuses, they turn their malice towards you.
They latch onto you with their gums, releasing a blood curdling scream.
That is what you last remember.

Omniscient Dog?
You’re awake already? That was quite the flamboyant scene.

You are in a hospital room, strapped to a bed.
Cloudy headed, you try to shift your body but can only muster a wimpy shiver.
Someone else is in the room with you—the surgeon.
Her body is bedecked with scrubs.
She’s smiling a little too much as far as you’re concerned.
In her hand is a scalpel.
You look down at your body.

Is that… your large intestine?
Your diaphragm is wide open, held by the strength of the surgeon’s retractor.
You see your entrails pulse with every heartbeat.
They are discombobulated, stuck in a confused frenzy to try and fix the system.
The surgeon lets out a coy laugh.

Ah, I’m so sorry! The sedatives must’ve worn off already.
I tell my nurses all the time, give my patients a stronger dose!
Get them real high; make the trip to the ER worth it!
But they never listen.
Oh, but your insides—they’re so beautiful!
I just want to…

Narrator
The surgeon’s eyes dilate, fascinated by your beautiful insides.
She excitedly shrieks and digs into your organs.
Like a child in a sandbox, she scoops them up and drops them.
Bringing them up to her face, she breathes in and moans.
Clearly your entrails must be of good quality.

Omniscient Dog?
This happenstance is all due to your free will.
I thought I told you to observe.
A good dog always listens to its master.
If there’s one thing to always live by, it’s loyalty.
But I see you fail at that as well.
To truly have autonomy is to have control over your earthly desires.
Disappointing. Truly, disappointing.
You are beyond redemption now.

Why the long face, my dear patient?
That makes me sad.
Don’t worry, things can get better!
I know! I got some clown therapy on speed dial.
But still… it would feel like such a waste.
I suppose there is another option.
Yes, you would be perfect for it!
How would you like to join an experiment?
Sacrifice your selfishness for a bigger, greater cause!
